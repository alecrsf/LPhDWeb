abstract: This work develops a simple methodology to make some contribution to current thinking about household participation in international financial markets. I combine standard microeconometrics with a latent model (multivariate statistics). This type of model is usually applied in the social sciences, but here it helps us to better identify the gap between actual international investor and potential international investor. The heterogeneity of agents can be useful to explain the behaviour of Italian families and its related economic problems, like equity home bias and equity premium puzzle.
