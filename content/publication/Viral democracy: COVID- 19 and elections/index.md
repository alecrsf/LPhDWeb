abstract: Elections are a mainstay of democracy, which provide the primary mechanism through which political leaders are chosen and held to account. Elections aggregate citizen interests at different levels of electoral unit (local, regional, and national), branch of government (executive and legislature), and timing (mid-term, primary, and general). The rise in the number of democracies (despite a recent backslide) since the 1970s means that any given year has seen a very large number of elections across all continents of the world.
