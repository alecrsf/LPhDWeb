abstract: The aim of this work is to apply a special kind of stochastic models toeconomics. A generalization of Ehrenfest urn is used in economic growththeory. This type of stochastic process is applied in the different sciences,here it helps us to predict the economic growth. In particular this workshow that the Ehrenfest urn capture the conditional convergence amongcountries, for instance, UK, France, Germany, Japan and USA
