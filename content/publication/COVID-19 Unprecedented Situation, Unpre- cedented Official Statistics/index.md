### COVID-19: 
#### Unprecedented Situation, Unprecedented Official Statistics

The  COVID-19  outbreak  dominated  the  beginning  of  2020.  Almost  every  country andevery  socio-economic  sector  is  facing  this  unique  situation.  Official  statistics  need  toconfront  new  challenges,  both  internally  and  externally.  Internally,  every  NationalStatistics Office (NSO) needs to protect their workers, reorganize their way of working,and  ensure  the  regular  statistics  production.  Externally,  NSOs  are  called  to  make  astatistical description of an unprecedented complex reality.The aim of an NSO is not only to produce official statistics but also to provide a realistic‘picture’ of our world, even in times of crisis. However, an official statistics system shouldnot  limit  itself  to  those  standard  tasks.  NSOs  should  provide  and  participate  to  theproduction  of  data  and  information  on  COVID-19.  For  instance,  the  United  NationsStatistics   Division   is   actively   recommending   guidelines,   sharing   experiences   andcollecting data for COVID-19 (United Nations Statistics Division 2020). However, underthe threat of COVID-19 many countries are considering official statistics as a non-essentialservice (Cheung 2020a). Are official statistics a non-essential service?The aim of this letter is: (1) to analyze the role of NSOs during the COVID-19 healthcrisis,  (2)  to  summarize  challenges  and  opportunities  lying  ahead,  (3)  to  trigger  thediscussion about the role of NSOs.For the sake of simplicity, let us distinguish between two different temporal phases ofthe COVID-19 epidemic. The first phase is predominated by health crisis and lockdown.This phase affects the population. The second phase starts when the health crisis is undercontrol (IAOS 2020). Once the lockdown has been revoked, the country is facing a newsocio-economic  situation  that  was  completely  unpredictable  in  January  2020.  This  lastphase is full of challenges and opportunities for NSOs.During  lockdown,  citizens  are  reading  or  listening  to  the  figures  of  new  COVID-19cases and daily deaths. These numbers are unreliable, not harmonized and scarce. They donot provide a secure starting point to understand the situation, nor do they help in makingproper  decisions.  What  drives  the  production  of  these  figures  –  cases  and  deaths  ofCOVID-19 – is a medical objective. These figures are necessary to diagnose and care forpatients. Nevertheless, we also need figures to better understand the spread of COVID-19.We need figures to help implement the lockdown only when and where lockdowns arenecessary. After the health crisis, we will need statistics to help us fully understand thenew socio-economic situation and the details of the economic recession. We need reliablefigures to plan for the future.
