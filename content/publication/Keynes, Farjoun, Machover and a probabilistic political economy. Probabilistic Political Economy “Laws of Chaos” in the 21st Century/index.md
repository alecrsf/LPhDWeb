abstract: In their book, “Law of Chaos, A probabilistic approach to politicaleconomy”, E. Farjoun and M. Machover, note that their survey “is anattempt to construct a non-deterministic theoretical framework for thefoundation of political economy”.  In the call for paper of this Confer-ence one reads that the publication in 1983 of this work “was an eventof genuine theoretical innovation in the field of political economy”. Thisstatement misses a important element.  It is true that ‘Law of Chaos’was the first attempt to treat explicitly economics in a probabilistic waybut in their efford, Farjoun and Machover completely forgotten Keynes’though. In other words, Keynes’s work has passed over in silence by thesetwo authors. Ironically, through history, Keynesian’s political economy isusually treated as a deterministic theory; as a theory having nothing todo with probability concept and notions. The fact that Keynes begun hisscientific work studying the foundations of probability and statistics formore than ten years is usually neglected. His famous, but not so muchread book, “A Treatise on Probability” published in 1921, summarizesthese studies. Through his study, Keynes gave an original contributionto the philosophy of probability, a widespread and deep review of theinferential statistics as it was understood in the nineteenth century espe-cially in Germany and a penetrating analysis of statistical and probabilitynotions. Were these long and accurate researches fully forgotten by theeconomic theorist Keynes? In our opinion they were not. In his economictheorizing Keynes accepted many mathematical concepts forged in thephysical science. In addition, he extensively but implicitly used proba-bility notions. The standpoint of Keynes is very different from that ofFarjoun and Machover.  It would be very usefull to take a closer lookon how much of the probabilistic ideas of Keynes are in. One can findmany examples that related with the concept of propensity in the con-tributions of Keyne’s, especially in ‘The general theory’ and in the workshe published later on. This notion has been considered a deterministicone. A parameter with a fixed value. On the contrary, there is at leastan occasion in which the ‘propensity to spent’ is explicitly considered asa probability distribution. In recent years has grown the interest about the influence of Keynes’s researches on the foundation of probability andstatistics on Keynes’ economics thought. It seems to us that it is worthto take Keynes’s probabilistic ideas into account in order to build up aprobabilistic political economy that carries on and surpasses the seminalwork of Farjoun and Machover.
