Generally speaking, Modern Slavery could be defined as severe exploitation of other people for their business gains. Millions of children and adults are trapped in slavery in every single country in the world. Modern Slavery is a complex phenomenon: mostly, illegal and hidden. It is difficult to take the right political decisions, without any statistical evidence, data and information. Therefore, policy-makers need reliable data to act against Modern Slavery. A problem is that the data is transversal to different economic and social sectors. Adequate statistics are often not available.\nFrom a statistical point of view, the Modern Slavery population is a hidden population (as COVID or HIV infected, illegal activities, prostitution and so on). To survey a hidden population, it is difficult to find a statistical sample. And, the questions normally are sensitive, so one could expect an extent of partial or total misreporting. Many techniques are available for a hidden population at micro level, nevertheless no one can guarantee soundly the statistical results.\nDoes Modern Slavery data in part already exist? As Modern Slavery is a horizontal phenomenon, data can be found in many other surveys that do not have the aim to measure Modern Slavery. For instance, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) does surveys on refugees and there are many questions about illegal activity. Those questions can be used to measure Modern Slavery. From these statistical methods will be applied to extract, in a methodological way, the relevant information of Modern Slavery. In addition to the statistical methods, another source of information is by accessing administrative data.\nThe official statistics offices already look after the illegal economic activities in the National Accounts (basically the GDP). Nevertheless, there are no statistical policies of any national statistics offices to measure Modern Slavery.\nTo identify proxy variables or to identify indirect measures of Modern Slavery (for instance to estimate illegal drug consumption, one can chemically analyse the drainage system or total tax evaders, one cannot pay tax in slavery). Connected with a proxy variable to find the interactions (for instance with an election or democracy) and the determinants that create a fertile environment for Modern Slavery can be another goal of this research. Partial democratic societies, as well as inequal and high-income societies, could represent a good combination to ‚Äòestablish‚Äô Modern Slavery. Also, natural and human phenomena can help the creation of Modern Slavery, like post-disaster, environmental degradation, deforestation, war and post-war environment. Some economic sectors seem to be more affected from Modern Slavery.\nModern Slavery is a multi-faceted phenomenon which affects not only the individual freedom, but also many other life essential decisions (pregnancy, location, life enjoyment and free time).\nThis vulnerability may be estimated from living conditions such as employment, health, education, and housing. It is important to monitor gender differences and age (children seem to be the most effected category) or citizenship status (maybe refugee, illegal immigration‚Ä¶), and, also, to understand the causes of these differences, in order to prepare strategies for more efficient intervention schemes aimed at the eradication of Modern Slavery.\nWhat should be the protocol to calculate Modern Slavery in the official statistics system? This complexity of Modern slavery poses challenges for many domains within official statistics and non-official statistics. It is indeed necessary to use different sources of data, statistics and administrative registers and to build a new set of static and dynamic indicators to develop at international, national and sub-national level. Those data can be contextualized in the framework of the measurement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations. In particular, it focuses on SDG 8.7, namely on forced labour under the effort of the International Labour Organization (ILO). This way, the official information derived from all the research studies on Modern Slavery could serve as a catalyst for participation in decision-making. Official statisticians are key actors for the realization of the right to information and for human rights in general (Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics). Thus, a protocol and suggestions for official statistics system to measure Modern Slavery is the operative and applied framework of this research. This idea could also have great and relevant practical implications to act against Modern Slavery.\nI‚Äôm looking forward to discussing these and other topics at the 2020 Virtual UN World Data Forum. The upholding of official data quality can contribute to build trust in official data and statistics, will play an crucial role in creating a more strong community.\n","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601510400,"objectID":"a7068e76766d0e8fa48f2ee9d07e067d","permalink":"https://lucadgsplendore.netlify.app/publication/measuring-modern-slavery/","publishdate":"2020-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/measuring-modern-slavery/","section":"publication","summary":"Why do we need to measure Modern Slavery?","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Measuring Modern Slavery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Di Gennaro Splendore"],"categories":null,"content":"COVID-19: Unprecedented Situation, Unprecedented Official Statistics The COVID-19 outbreak dominated the beginning of 2020. Almost every country andevery socio-economic sector is facing this unique situation. Official statistics need toconfront new challenges, both internally and externally. Internally, every NationalStatistics Office (NSO) needs to protect their workers, reorganize their way of working,and ensure the regular statistics production. Externally, NSOs are called to make astatistical description of an unprecedented complex reality.The aim of an NSO is not only to produce official statistics but also to provide a realistic‚Äòpicture‚Äô of our world, even in times of crisis. However, an official statistics system shouldnot limit itself to those standard tasks. NSOs should provide and participate to theproduction of data and information on COVID-19. For instance, the United NationsStatistics Division is actively recommending guidelines, sharing experiences andcollecting data for COVID-19 (United Nations Statistics Division 2020). However, underthe threat of COVID-19 many countries are considering official statistics as a non-essentialservice (Cheung 2020a). Are official statistics a non-essential service?The aim of this letter is: (1) to analyze the role of NSOs during the COVID-19 healthcrisis, (2) to summarize challenges and opportunities lying ahead, (3) to trigger thediscussion about the role of NSOs.For the sake of simplicity, let us distinguish between two different temporal phases ofthe COVID-19 epidemic. The first phase is predominated by health crisis and lockdown.This phase affects the population. The second phase starts when the health crisis is undercontrol (IAOS 2020). Once the lockdown has been revoked, the country is facing a newsocio-economic situation that was completely unpredictable in January 2020. This lastphase is full of challenges and opportunities for NSOs.During lockdown, citizens are reading or listening to the figures of new COVID-19cases and daily deaths. These numbers are unreliable, not harmonized and scarce. They donot provide a secure starting point to understand the situation, nor do they help in makingproper decisions. What drives the production of these figures ‚Äì cases and deaths ofCOVID-19 ‚Äì is a medical objective. These figures are necessary to diagnose and care forpatients. Nevertheless, we also need figures to better understand the spread of COVID-19.We need figures to help implement the lockdown only when and where lockdowns arenecessary. After the health crisis, we will need statistics to help us fully understand thenew socio-economic situation and the details of the economic recession.

It begins with explaining why elections are a vital part of democracy, and then using the notion of the electoral cycle, constructs a risk matrix that assesses the relative impact and likelihood of risks to the cycle, as well as proposes a number of potential mitigations to these risks. The variety and number of elections, dimensions of the electoral cycle that can be disrupted, and the need for solutions raises significant questions about the future of democracy itself.","tags":["Democracy","Elections","Electoral cycle","Electoral risk","COVID-19"],"title":"Pandemic Democracy: Elections and COVID-19","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Di Gennaro Splendore"],"categories":null,"content":"Quality of Data If you don‚Äôt do any blood tests then you don‚Äôt have high cholesterol. The cases of COVID-19 depend on how many persons each country tested and how they were tested. For instance availability of the test, asymptomatic cases, whether only the people in the hospital are tested, or whether only the people in contact with infected people are tested, random test‚Ä¶ The number of cases of COVID-19 is not a trustable measure of how many people are infected by COVIS-19. Moreover, it is useless for comparison. Infection by the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, though confirmation is ultimately by an appropriate test. In most countries, the COVID-19 test policy changed over time. More probable than not we cannot compare over time the data of the same country.\nThe number of cases of COVID-19 is essential to calculate the Case Fatality Rate (CFR). The ‚Äúmortality rate‚Äù is different from the CFR¬π. I read quite a lot of confusing thoughts in the media. The CFR is the proportion of deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease: deaths by COVID-19 of the total diagnosed cases of COVID-19. Whereas, the mortality rate is a measure of the number of deaths in a particular population.\nIs there an overestimation of the CFR of COVID-19? Probably yes, if we calculate the CFR of COVID-19: death from COVID-19 to cases of infection of COVID-19. And if you underestimate the cases of infection of COVID-19, your case fatality rate (CFR) is higher. The cases of the infected are at the lower bound of the real situation. Seeing that we have not tested all of the population, in this case, this figure can be greatly biased downwards due to the non scientific sampling of the number of infections of COVID-19. The cases of COVID-19 should be tested by conducting a scientific random sample.\nWe need proper information The cases of COVID-19 should be tested by conducting a scientific random sample. Thanks to the scientific sample we can have all the information to fully understand the situation. For instance, if we want to analyse the Spanish or Maltaese situation, then the random sampling should be extracted from the entire Spanish or Maltese population. We can randomly select approximately 1000 people from amongst the Spanish people. Then every person in the sample will be tested (COVID-19 swab) but then they will also receive a questionnaire. The questionnaire will be focused on social habits, such as travelling, going to restaurants, family meetings, pubs, discos and whether they had contact with people with the COVID-19 virus. Like that we can have a picture of the phenomena and understand how many people have asymptomatic COVID-19.\nA sample COVID19 representative of the population From the entire population, a random sample representative of the population can be extracted. Every person in the sample will be tested for the COVID-19 (swab) and probably also his/her relatives. A questionnaire should accompany this random COVID-19 test survey. Questions on personal health conditions, social connections, traveling and social habits in the last weeks could be asked to the people. Probably this exercise could be repeated periodically until a stable situation is obtained or reached. A random stratified sample with an error margin of 2% at 95% confidence is needed.\nIn conclusion: Without data on the COVID-19 we cannot possibly understand how the pandemic is progressing locally.\nWithout data we cannot respond appropriately to the threat; neither as individuals nor as a society. Nor can we learn where countermeasures against the pandemic are working.\nNote:\nInfection Fatality Rate (IFR) does not equal CFR. To calculate IFR you need to know the number of infected in the total population. IFR of COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.3‚Äì1%. In both measures, IFR and CFR, the important question is: How many people are infected? IFR will likely underestimate infection and if only those with more severe symptoms are screened, CFR will likely overestimate the fatality.\n","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"f55ae16d4ffb2ea18933584d0954d6cc","permalink":"https://lucadgsplendore.netlify.app/publication/random-testing-quality-of-data-and-lack-of-information-covid-19-data-policy/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/random-testing-quality-of-data-and-lack-of-information-covid-19-data-policy/","section":"publication","summary":"Quality of Data If you don‚Äôt do any blood tests then you don‚Äôt have high cholesterol.

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-548367912', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

Il destination management del binomio Costa Brava ‚Äì Barcellona √® imperniato sulla cultura delle tre ‚ÄúL‚Äù, ovvero Landscape, Leasure e Learning che definiscono un turismo attivo e propositivo affiancato da un‚Äôincisiva azione concreta, attraverso investimenti strategici da parte delle pubbliche amministrazioni che hanno destinato allo sviluppo turistico il 6,4% del PIL cio√® circa il doppio dell‚Äôinvestimento dei vari organi di governo nella Riviera di Rimini (3,5% del PIL). La valorizzazione del turismo catalano e della Costa Brava √® stato supportata da investimenti pubblici che ne hanno assicurato il successo attraverso il coinvolgimento attivo e sinergico dei tre livelli di governo: centrale, regionale e municipale. I risultati dimostrano che √® stato un investimento efficiente e che la spesa pubblica √® stata ampiamente ripagata dai benefici per la popolazione, per l‚Äôoccupazione e per la qualit√† della vita nell‚Äôarea (maggiori entrate da tasse e minori spese per il welfare). L‚Äôanalisi del posizionamento delle tre destinazioni ha messo in evidenza marcate differenze ed ha mostrato la debolezza dell‚Äôofferta riminese, soprattutto sui mercati esteri. Le difficolt√† sui mercati internazionali sono molto negative in questa fase di globalizzazione, ma sono anche il segnale pi√π rilevante di deficit strategici e della necessit√† di introdurre modifiche strutturali del management di prodotto e di destinazione. L‚Äôaccessibilit√† (aerea, viaria , marina e ferroviaria) √® un fattore di successo del sistema turistico ‚ÄúBarcellona - Costa Brava‚Äù che utilizza anche i canali telematici sia per la comunicazione, sia per la commercializzazione (booking e pagamento on line). Le infrastrutture telematiche della Riviera di Rimini sono pi√π lente di quelle dei competitor e sono meno utilizzate. Il capitale umano costituisce un ulteriore fattore di debolezza della Riviera di Rimini rispetto ai competitor. La Croazia punta molto sulla professionalit√† degli operatori. Le imprese investono in corsi di aggiornamento per i propri dipendenti, poich√© la qualificazione del personale √® ritenuta fondamentale per una ospitalit√† eccellente. L‚Äôanalisi comparata dei risultati conseguiti dalle tre destinazioni in cui √® stata identificata l‚Äôarena paradigmatica di confronto, sulla base dei risultati dell‚Äôanalisi del posizionamento, ha chiaramente confermato la qualificazione benchmark (best performer) della Costa Brava per alcuni aspetti e delle Coste Croate per altri. Il trend dell‚Äôattivit√† turistica della Costa Brava √® molto sostenuto: le presenze crescono ad un tasso medio di 8,1 punti all‚Äôanno Le Coste Croate sono caratterizzate da un trend delle presenze turistiche meno sostenuto (+3,9 punti all‚Äôanno), ma comunque rilevante, mentre la Riviera di Rimini evidenzia una sostanziale stagnazione delle presenze (+0,9% annuo).

Farjoun and M. Machover, note that their survey ‚Äúis anattempt to construct a non-deterministic theoretical framework for thefoundation of political economy‚Äù.  In the call for paper of this Confer-ence one reads that the publication in 1983 of this work ‚Äúwas an eventof genuine theoretical innovation in the field of political economy‚Äù. Thisstatement misses a important element.  It is true that ‚ÄòLaw of Chaos‚Äôwas the first attempt to treat explicitly economics in a probabilistic waybut in their efford, Farjoun and Machover completely forgotten Keynes‚Äôthough. In other words, Keynes‚Äôs work has passed over in silence by thesetwo authors. Ironically, through history, Keynesian‚Äôs political economy isusually treated as a deterministic theory; as a theory having nothing todo with probability concept and notions. The fact that Keynes begun hisscientific work studying the foundations of probability and statistics formore than ten years is usually neglected. His famous, but not so muchread book, ‚ÄúA Treatise on Probability‚Äù published in 1921, summarizesthese studies. Through his study, Keynes gave an original contributionto the philosophy of probability, a widespread and deep review of theinferential statistics as it was understood in the nineteenth century espe-cially in Germany and a penetrating analysis of statistical and probabilitynotions. Were these long and accurate researches fully forgotten by theeconomic theorist Keynes? In our opinion they were not. In his economictheorizing Keynes accepted many mathematical concepts forged in thephysical science. In addition, he extensively but implicitly used proba-bility notions. The standpoint of Keynes is very different from that ofFarjoun and Machover.  It would be very usefull to take a closer lookon how much of the probabilistic ideas of Keynes are in. One can findmany examples that related with the concept of propensity in the con-tributions of Keyne‚Äôs, especially in ‚ÄòThe general theory‚Äô and in the workshe published later on. This notion has been considered a deterministicone. A parameter with a fixed value. On the contrary, there is at leastan occasion in which the ‚Äòpropensity to spent‚Äô is explicitly considered asa probability distribution. In recent years has grown the interest about the influence of Keynes‚Äôs researches on the foundation of probability andstatistics on Keynes‚Äô economics thought. It seems to us that it is worthto take Keynes‚Äôs probabilistic ideas into account in order to build up aprobabilistic political economy that carries on and surpasses the seminalwork of Farjoun and Machover.","tags":["Probability"],"title":"Keynes, Farjoun, Machover and a probabilistic political economy.
