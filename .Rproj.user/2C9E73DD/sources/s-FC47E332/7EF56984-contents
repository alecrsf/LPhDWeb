I have been dedicating the last 25 years of my life to statistics. I accumulated years of increasingly significant experience in statistical consultancy in real economy, electoral processes and official statistics.
I have in-depth knowledge of development cooperation dynamics and official statistics of Eurostat, International Monetary Fund and United Nation; comparative experience in developing and leading statistical projects with teams of over 50 nationalities in different 15 countries with European Union (EU), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and National Democratic Institute (NDI).
I was professor in Statistics at University Pompeu Fabra (Spain) for 5 years and I hold a PhD in Statistics. I am authored several publications in the area of applied statistics and, among other, I presented in New York University, European Parliament, International Statistical Institute, Econometric Society, International Economic Association and European Survey Research Association.
